									This event is organized via an online platform, chiefly requiring a
									file-sharing medium.The participant is provided with an executable file and
									examples for the program that it runs. The participant then must infer the
									working of the logic and write code to emulate the program.
									</p>

									<p>
									It is an offline event that is organized under team supervision.It
									aims to check the syntactic and logical awareness of the participant, where
									they must “debug” a given snippet offline code, i.e. free it of all possible errors
									so that it works perfectly.

									<p>
									It is a coding-based exercise that is organized on an online
									platform.The participant is given a simple logical problem for which he/she
									must write an “short” piece of code, decided on the basis of length, time of
									execution etc. The shortest code that perfectly solves the problem, wins.

									It is a cryptography based event that uses the prevalent encryption
									methods to weave a path for the user to find a hidden message, which wins
									them the competition.The participant is given a file which they have to
									examine thoroughly and find a clue to the next step in the puzzle, and they
									should also know when to stop too. The one reaching furthest in the chain
									wins the competition.

									The event Chemicar brings you an opportunity of building up a car fuelled by simple reaction mechanisms.
									Just grab a plastic bottle and using chemicals provided by us, design your own car to enter this race of
									Chemicar. We not only provide you with the beguiling fun but also this is a way of promoting other fuelling methods that can be employed. In the light of recent scarcity of energy sources such as fossil fuels, chemically powered cars prove as an efficient alternative source.

									Engineer of the year is basically an on the spot event in which we test the skills, imagination and technical info of participants. This event consists of two rounds. In the first round, by using the given materials a hydraulic bridge is to be made and its strength will be tested according to how much weight it can bear. The winners will be short listed and in the second round using the knowledge of hydraulics, a crusher has to be made. Basing on its strength and ability to crush substances, the winner will be decided. Hope to see your participation

									Prepare and get placed in the easiest way possible. Stay a step ahead of the competition by practicing with our mock placement. It’s not so uncustomary to have few dream companies at the back of the mind before you even are in the final year of your studies. But, once you have jotted down what your dream companies are, what’s next? We are here to give you that placement feel with aptitude test followed by group discussion leading towards personal interviews, conducted by our professionals. The more you practice your dream company’s placement tests, the more are your chances to get the foot in the door.

									The idea is to make edible water bottles, a blob like water container. This biodegradable blob aims to provide convenience of plastic bottles while limiting the environmental impact. A demo will be provided for the formation of bottles by the team members. And then in the competition you have to create OHOO bottles of appropriate size with raw materials (sodium alginate, calcium lactate and water) issued by us in restricted period of time and fixed amount. It is a small initiative by us to contribute to the environment. These bottles come in various flavours and colours, as desired making it more fun, cheap and reliable. This is an on the spot event whose main requirement is your presence. Hope to see your participation.

									Rocketile is a type of rocket propellent for model rockets made with isopropyl alcohol as a fuel and spark of fire as igniter. The idea is to make isopropyl alcohol powered rocket with waste water bottle, so as to replace them with fire work rockets, since fireworks can be very dangerous and are prone to landing on things that might be combustible. This has made fireworks difficult. Most cities have completely outlawed fireworks within the city limit. The participants will learn about the alcohol rockets and how they work and how different aerodynamic designs can affect the height of flight.

									Our event focuses on making a simple centrifugal water pump. It is an on the spot event where participants will be provided with motors, GI sheet and other basics. The participants will be allowed to take part in a team of max two. The participants will be evaluated on basis of their design and the capacity of their pump to deliver water for certain height and flow. Successful completion of the task within minimum time will decide the winner. The event is focused to test the technical skills of participant and knowledge of fluid dynamics by how they design the pump. HOPE TO SEE YOU IN THE EVENTS!!

									This event will have a haamer to hit push button. As soon as the push button is hit t the LED will glow.There wil l be several push buttons in the arena connected to different LED’s. There will be two  teams having there separate bots. Aim of each team would be to glow as many LED’s as they can in specified time period.

									As human beings, we  respond to stimuli. Our actions are due to the feedback given by our sensory
									organs. An edge detection event is the simplest way to demonstrate that. Sensing an edge and maneuvering the robot to stay on arena for a given time period.Obstacle avoider bot basically detect the edge of arena.If it is detecting an edge it will respond such that it will not fall down. Robot have to stay on arena for a given period of time .
